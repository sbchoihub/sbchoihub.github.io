### About Me
I am a <b>Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering</b> at <b>Hongik University</b>, specializing in <a href='#'>computational modeling of plasma-assisted hydrocarbon conversion</a>.  
My research focuses on developing <b>optimized kinetic mechanisms</b> and <b>numerical simulations</b> for plasma pyrolysis, with applications in hydrogen production and sustainable energy.  
I aim to bridge hermal-fluid simulations with chemical kinetics to design efficient plasma processes for cleaner energy systems.



### Research Highlights
- **Publications**: Published in the *International Journal of Hydrogen Energy* on plasma-assisted hydrocarbon pyrolysis  
- **Presentations**: Delivered oral presentations at international conferences, including ISPC26 (2025) and 13th-ISNTP (2024)  
- **Projects**: Generated chemical reaction mechanisms targeting plasma-driven high-temperature environments and predicted product distributions through computational simulations
